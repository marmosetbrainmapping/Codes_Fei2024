Instructions on codes:
1. In /structure-connectivity-analysis-for-two-datasets/ directory, it contains analysis codes associated with allen-population tracing data and single-neuron data.
    The codes are provided for generating the figure 1, figure S1 and figure S2. And the nomenclature of each code comprehensively specifies its purpose and its intended image analysis context.
    Fig1-S1-draw_connection_strength_figure.m:  This code is intended for the visualization of heatmaps representing the intrahemispheric connectivity matrix, interhemispheric connectivity matrix, and the corresponding difference matrix.
    Fig1-extract_PFC_region_form_sc.m: This code is designed to perform the extraction of prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions from a set of 43 cortical regions for use in Figure 1.
    Fig1-determined_reginal_subtype.m: This code is used for deterimining regional types based on the 3 types of projection regions.
  
2. In /wide-field-data-Figure5andFigure6/ directory,  it contains analysis codes associated with wide field data.
    The codes are provided for generating the figure 5, figure6, figure S7 , figure S8and figure S9. And the nomenclature of each code comprehensively specifies its purpose and its intended image analysis context.

3. In /computational modelling/ directory, it contains the codes for quantifying heterogeneity from single-neuron projectome data (results for Fig.2) and all the model simulations (results for Fig.3&4).
